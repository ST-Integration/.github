<h1 align="center">Hey ðŸ‘‹What's Up?</h1>

# What this is
This is our official GitHub repository where we will post all of our software, api or other projects related to ST Integration.

# Best Practice
Please follow this process extesively as this will make managing/finding and using content correctly much easier.

## Creating a new Repo
Note: If you do not follow these steps correctly then I will be having a discussion with you!
- Please first ensure a new Repo is actually required
  - I do not want to find two repositories that are the exact same thing, I will merge them.
- Please ensure proper naming of the repo, I will rename your repo if it does not follow convention correctly.
  - Naming Convention: CamelCase - ProjectName/Purpose (MediPost-API or MediPostAPI).
- After you have created the Repo and uploaded the relevant files please ensure you do the following:
  - Create a README containing a Title, Description and Installation Instructions.
  - If, in the future, we need to open your project a certain way and you do not give instruction then it slows down the whole process.


This README will be maintained and updated as development continues
