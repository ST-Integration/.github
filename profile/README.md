# Best Practice
Please follow this process exesively as this will make managing/finding and using content correctly much easier.

## Creating a new Repo
Note: If you do not follow these steps correctly then I will be having a discussion with you!
- Please first ensure a new Repo is actually required
  I do not want to find two repositories that are the exact same thing, I will merge them.
- Please ensure proper naming of the repo, I will rename your repo if it does not follow convention correctly.
  Naming Convention: CamelCase - ProjectName/Purpose (MediPost-API or MediPostAPI).
